Hello there! I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://centerfordesignresearch.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Center for Design Research</b></a> at Stanford University, as part of the <a href="https://me.stanford.edu/groups/about-design-group" target="_blank"><b>Design Group</b></a> at Stanford Department of Mechanical Engineering. My PhD work has been supervised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/larry-leifer" target="_blank"><b>Larry Leifer</b></a> (Primary Advisor), <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/sheri-sheppard" target="_blank"><b>Sheri Sheppard</b></a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/" target="_blank"><b>Hazel Markus</b></a>, and <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/roypea" target="_blank"><b>Roy Pea</b></a>. I am graduating this Fall (Dec. 2021), and will be working with Hazel Markus as a postdoc fellow in 2022. <br>
<br>
My research is at the intersection of design research, affective science, learning sciences, and cultural psychology. I am a hard-core engineer turned social science researcher. <b>I am especially interested in revealing the functional role of emotion that is central to learning, discovery and invention</b>. <br>

	<br>

	<br>	
	I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou" target="_blank"><b>Yangzhou</b></a>, China, attended a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Nanjing_Normal_University" target="_blank"><b>life-changing highschool in Nanjing</b><a>, and pursued study and research in Spacecraft Design and Engineering at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology" target="_blank">Harbin Institute of Technology</a> (2006-2010), where I met my husband—my best friend. I had a great opportunity to conduct fluid dynamics research with wonderful professors at <a href="https://www.ubi.pt/" target="_blank"><b>Universidade da Beira Interior, Portugal</b></a> for a summer in 2009. In 2010, I entered graduate school at Stanford University, and spent my first year working on satellite structure redesign for Lockheed Martin and a wonderful design team at Stanford and Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México(UNAM). Through the perplexing yet eye-opening cultural clash experiences during my Master’s program (2010-2012), I was deeply influenced by the human-centered design principles and the iterative, collaborative design practices that extended my technical rationality-oriented mind. 
Inspired by my own learning experience, I landed on a job as an Innovation Specialist at Siemens to examine how to apply design thinking to educate engineering scientists. These years of participatory observation, as a teacher, a coach and a teammate, enabled me to deeply empathize with engineers and motivated me to look for ways to support their emotional needs for creativity and growth experiences. I returned to Stanford as a PhD student in 2016, looking for ways to support engineers' needs for growth and creativity in culturally responsive ways. These years of investigation have led me to an important, yet marginally researched area—<b>the emotions and feelings underlying technology design</b>. I forged into the interdisciplinary field of design research, cultural psychology and learning sciences, as I sought for research lenses and tools to analyze the collisions in the forms of confusions, anxieties and surprises that engineers and designers would inevitably experience as they strive to build up abilities and mindsets to collaboratively, creatively and effectively cope with real-world complexities. Eventually, what became of my dissertation—the constructive role of <a href="files/13_ijee3902.pdf" target="_blank"><b>perplexity</b></a>, <a href="files/situated_emotion_design_studies.pdf" target="_blank"><b>emotion</b></a>, and <a href="files/Ge_ICLS_2021_Proceedings.pdf" target="_blank"><b>emotional disturbance</b></a> in collaborative design—has also allowed me to learn, and to see design from different and richer perspectives.
<br>
<br>
Engineering education emphasizes “think”, not “feel”. Engineers do not talk about emotions. How to address the dearth of attention to emotions and feelings in technological work? To show that emotion matters, I examined how emotion is functional in critical moments of learning and concept change during the process of product design. By uniquely integrating approaches from linguistics and learning sciences, I developed a novel mixed-methods approach that demystifies the emotionally disturbing processes in dealing with challenging, schema-incongruent situations in contemporary product design work. More specifically, I examined how experienced designers embrace, adapt and change points of view to deal with emotional perturbations and conceptual inconsistency, as well as how they fail to do so, during the process of socio-technical innovation work; this was achieved through a need-based, idiographic approach that I have developed to adaptively use a variety of behavioral measures, despite discordance amongst them, as a reliable sensor to recognize emotional disturbances beyond categorization and characterize emotion in situ.
	<br>
	
	
Looking ahead, I continue to ask the questions that have led me to academia. The world needs engineers and designers who can creatively and effectively work with wicked problems,
unstructured objectives, uncertain processes and unfamiliar stakeholders. Increasingly, new kinds of
problems emerge, roles of societal participants blend, and previously unexamined cultural paradigms are
being challenged. By revealing the constructive role of emotion in real-world creative design work, I look for ways to support engineers’ needs for creativity and growth experiences in culturally responsive ways.
The long-term goal of my research is to build a novel, empirically grounded understanding about how awareness of and knowledge about emotion could enable equitable interaction and creative performance in smart technology-augmented groups and teams. So far, my efforts to pursue this goal have been guided by the following questions: (1) How is emotion associated to development of knowledge and design concepts? (2) Do cultural differences (e.g., gender, ethnicity) in emotional behaviors contribute to inequitable interactions? (3) How to leverage technological tools to improve culturally-responsive emotion awareness in small groups and teams?
 <br>
<br>
I want to contribute my research career to closing the gap between the value of our
educational, institutional systems in engineering disciplines—precise conceptual knowledge in pursuit of
an optimized answer, and what our society needs, today and future—abilities and mindsets to bridge
science and art of engineering to solve ill-defined societal problems where ends are often confused and
conflicting.
