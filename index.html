Hi! I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://centerfordesignresearch.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Center for Design Research</b></a> at Stanford University, as part of the <a href="https://me.stanford.edu/groups/about-design-group" target="_blank"><b>Design Group</b></a> at Stanford Department of Mechanical Engineering. My PhD work is supervised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/larry-leifer" target="_blank">Larry Leifer</a> (Primary Advisor), Sheri Sheppard, Hazel Markus, and Roy Pea. I am graduating this Fall, and will be working with Hazel Markus as a postdoc fellow in 2022 on a few projects. <br>
<br>
My research is at the intersection of design research, affective science, learning sciences, and cultural psychology. I am a hard-core engineer turned social science researcher. I am especially interested in revealing the invisible roles of emotions that are central to discovery and invention. In many fields, emotions are still cast as noise in the system that interferes with good or rational thinking. The current questions driving my research are: How to investigate the
constitutive role of emotion in technology design and technology-mediated learning and work? And how to make visible the important role of emotion? <br>
<br>	
I grew up in Yangzhou, China, attended a life-changing highschool in Nanjing, and pursued study and research in Spacecraft Design and Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology (2006-2010). I had a great opportunity to conduct fluid dynamics research with wonderful professors at Universidade da Beira Interior, Portugal for a summer in 2009. <br> 
As I was funneled through one of the most rigorous technology & engineering science educational systems in China, I unmistakably developed a faith in machines and the systematic ways of machine design that I was taught. At that time, I did not know that I would soon collide into very different social and cultural realities of design, as I entered graduate school at Stanford University. Through the perplexing yet eye-opening cultural clash experiences during my Master’s program (2010-2012), I was deeply influenced by the human-centered design principles and the iterative, collaborative design practices that extended my technical rationality-oriented mind. 
Inspired and motivated by my own learning experience, I landed on a job to examine how to apply design thinking to educate engineering scientists in a high-tech organization. My team and I created a design thinking program to guide engineers to tackle technological innovation challenges. Despite the initial curiosity and excitement, most of the engineers expressed tremendous frustration and bewilderment during and after the program. Eventually, few of their ideas survived the risk-averse gatekeepers. Moreover, the new engineering design practices were discouraged by their social norms. These years of participatory observation, as a teacher, a coach and a teammate, enabled me to deeply empathize with engineers and motivated me to look for ways to support their needs for creativity and growth experiences. 
<br>
	<br>
What qualities enable engineers to thrive when their values get challenged? How to help engineers turn roadblocks into novel and meaningful experiences? I returned to Stanford as a PhD student in 2016, seeking an answer. These years of investigation have led me to an important, yet marginally researched area—the emotions and feelings underlying technology design [2]. I forged into the interdisciplinary field of design research, cultural psychology and learning sciences, as I sought for research lenses and tools to analyze the collisions in the forms of confusions, anxieties and surprises that engineers and designers would inevitably experience as they strive to build up abilities and mindsets to collaboratively, creatively and effectively cope with real-world complexities. Eventually, what became of my dissertation—the constructive role of perplexity [3] and emotional disturbance [2,4] in collaborative design—has also allowed me to learn, and to see design from different and richer perspectives.
<br>
	<br>
Looking ahead, I continue to ask the questions that have led me to academia. The world needs engineers and designers who can creatively and effectively work with wicked problems,
unstructured objectives, uncertain processes and unfamiliar stakeholders. Increasingly, new kinds of
problems emerge, roles of societal participants blend, and previously unexamined cultural paradigms are
being challenged. Looking ahead, I will continue my research inquiry into the engineering mind—What
constitutes engineering? What makes a good engineer? And how can we help our students get there? <br>
<br>
Ultimately, I want to contribute my research career to closing the gap between the value of our
educational, institutional systems in engineering disciplines—precise conceptual knowledge in pursuit of
an optimized answer, and what our society needs, today and future—abilities and mindsets to bridge
science and art of engineering to solve ill-defined societal problems where ends are often confused and
conflicting.
