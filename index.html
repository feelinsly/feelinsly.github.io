Hello there! I am a researcher at <a href="https://centerfordesignresearch.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Center for Design Research</b></a> in Mechanical Engineering and Psychology Department at Stanford University. I recently received my PhD degree in Jan, 2022 from the <a href="https://me.stanford.edu/groups/about-design-group" target="_blank"><b>Design Group</b></a> at Stanford Department of Mechanical Engineering. My PhD work was supervised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/larry-leifer" target="_blank"><b>Larry Leifer</b></a> (Primary Advisor), <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/sheri-sheppard" target="_blank"><b>Sheri Sheppard</b></a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/" target="_blank"><b>Hazel Markus</b></a>, and <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/roypea" target="_blank"><b>Roy Pea</b></a>. My current postdoc work is supervised by Hazel Markus.<br>
<br>

My work is at the intersection of design research, affective science, learning sciences, and cultural psychology. I am a hard-core engineer turned interdisciplinary researcher. <b> My research develops theories, empirical studies, and technological tools to understand how emotions and feelings that accompany work on ill-defined design problems can be harnessed by engineers and designers to enable and extend the creative process</b> (Example work: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142694X21000314" target="_blank">[Paper LINK]</a>). <br>
<br>


	<br>	
	I grew up in a small town in China, in a historical city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou" target="_blank"><b>Yangzhou</b></a>. I attended a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Nanjing_Normal_University" target="_blank"><b>life-changing high school in Nanjing</b><a>, and pursued study and research in Spacecraft Design and Engineering at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology" target="_blank">Harbin Institute of Technology</a> (2006-2010), where I met my husband who's also been my best friend. I had a great opportunity to conduct fluid dynamics research with wonderful professors at <a href="https://www.ubi.pt/" target="_blank"><b>Universidade da Beira Interior, Portugal</b></a> for a summer in 2009. In 2010, I entered graduate school at Stanford University, and spent my first year working on satellite structure redesign for Lockheed Martin with a wonderful design team at Stanford and Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México(UNAM). Through the perplexing yet eye-opening cultural clash experiences during my Master’s program (2010-2012), I was deeply influenced by the human-centered design principles and the iterative, collaborative design practices that extended my technical rationality-oriented mind. <br>
Inspired by my own learning experience, I landed on a job as an Innovation Specialist at Siemens to examine how to apply design thinking to educate engineering scientists. These years of participatory observation, as a teacher, a coach and a teammate, enabled me to deeply empathize with engineers and motivated me to look for ways to support their emotional needs for creativity and growth experiences. I returned to Stanford as a PhD student in 2016, looking for ways to support engineers' needs for growth and creativity in culturally responsive ways. These years of investigation have led me to an important, yet marginally researched area—<b>the emotions and feelings underlying technology design</b>. I forged into the interdisciplinary field of design research, cultural psychology and learning sciences, as I sought for research lenses and tools to analyze the collisions in the forms of confusions, anxieties and surprises that engineers and designers would inevitably experience as they strive to build up abilities and mindsets to collaboratively, creatively and effectively cope with real-world complexities. Eventually, what became of my dissertation—the constructive role of <a href="files/13_ijee3902.pdf" target="_blank"><b>perplexity</b></a>, <a href="files/situated_emotion_design_studies.pdf" target="_blank"><b>emotion</b></a>, and <a href="files/Ge_ICLS_2021_Proceedings.pdf" target="_blank"><b>emotional disturbance</b></a> in collaborative design—has also allowed me to learn, and to see design from different and richer perspectives.
<br>
	<br>
	
	
Looking ahead, I continue to ask the questions that have led me to pursuing my PhD degree. The world needs engineers and designers who can creatively and effectively work with wicked problems,
unstructured objectives, uncertain processes and unfamiliar stakeholders. Increasingly, new kinds of
problems emerge, roles of societal participants blend, and previously unexamined cultural paradigms are
being challenged. How to bring up our next-generation engineers? I will continue look for ways to support our engineers' and designers’ needs for creativity and growth experiences in culturally responsive ways.
 <br>
<br>
Ultimately, I want to contribute my career to closing the gap between the value of our
educational, institutional systems in engineering disciplines—precise conceptual knowledge in pursuit of
an optimized answer, and what our society needs, today and future—abilities and mindsets to bridge
science and art of engineering to solve ill-defined societal problems where ends are often confused and
conflicting.
