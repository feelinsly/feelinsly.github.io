</p><p style="text-align:left">
              In early 2012, I learnt a course - <em>DESIGN WHAT?</em> by <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/bio/michael-barry/" title="Michael's profile" target="_blank">Michael Barry</a>, in which a story about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water" title="This is Water - by David Foster Wallace" target="_blank">two fishes and water</a> was told. A simple but reverberant revealation: The most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. This is the most fundamental asset of human-centered design that I have carried along. 
 </p>
<p style="text-align:left">
"Human-centered" doesn't necessarily limit the scope of focus on "user". It asks a designer to build empathy with users, sponsors, teammates, outsiders, non-experts,etc. It also doesn't limit the scope to 
"people", it asks a designer to be bio-inspired and cross-disciplinarily triggered. To build up empathy is to build up the critical AND open mindset.</p>

              

              <p style="text-align:left">

              To see the water is non-intuitive, habit-reversive, and simply difficult. It doesn't require a PhD degree or a special title to practice empathy, but it's worth a life-long practice. I simply experiment it with fun and rewards everyday.

            </p>

            <p style="text-align:left">  

              To learn more about my experience in a human-centered approach, take a look at <a href="Portfolio.html" title="Xiao's project portfolio">my past projects</a>.

                Fail, fail early and often, so as to succeed sooner. It's easy to say but really hard to do.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left"> I like being buried in my slow thoughts - wondering, reflecting and daydreaming. Fantacy. And the opposite me would get agitated seeing myself idle in long thoughts: Get up and get your hands dirty! You can't enjoy the trip only by reading <em>The loney planet</em>, you must experience it. </p><p style="text-align:left">That's the eternal fight between the two little puppets inside me, but I enjoy being an action-driven slow thinker. Fast doing, that's the mechanical engineer side of me. Slow thinking, that's the artistic and research side of me.
